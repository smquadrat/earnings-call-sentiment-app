# earnings-call-sentiment-app

This Flask app provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input an earnings call transcript and receive a sentiment score based on the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model, which is implemented using the NLTK Python library. The app analyzes forward-looking transcript sentences that contain keywords such as "forecast", "potential", and "next year", and highlights specific lines that are tagged as positive or negative to derive the sentiment score.
